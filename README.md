## 🧭 About
**SyncFleet** is a **real-time group tracking and alert system** designed for scenarios where multiple people or vehicles move together — rides, deliveries, rescue missions, or group travel.  

Users can:  
- Create or join rooms  
- Share live locations  
- Send alerts (including SOS)  
- Detect anomalies such as when a member strays from the group or remains stationary for too long  

---

## 🌟 Why SyncFleet?
Traditional tracking apps focus on **individual location sharing**. SyncFleet solves a **group-level coordination problem**:

- Teams need to know not just *where* someone is, but also *how they’re moving compared to the group*.  
- In critical use cases (rescue, fleet management, school buses, travel groups), **real-time anomalies matter** — e.g., if a member stops moving, deviates from the path, or triggers an SOS.  
- Communication is **context-aware**: location data is integrated with chat and alerts for seamless coordination.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🗺️ **Full-screen real-time map** with live user markers  
- 📍 **Unique pins & trails** showing each user’s movement path  
- 📡 **Live socket updates** for location and chat  
- 🚨 **SOS alerts & anomaly detection** (stationary too long, deviating from group)  
- 💬 **Room-based chat** for quick coordination  
- 👥 **User panel** showing active users, last-seen status, and SOS triggers  
- 🎨 **Clean, modern UI** with Tailwind + ShadCN

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** → component-based UI  
- **TailwindCSS + ShadCN** → responsive, modern styling  
- **Leaflet.js** → interactive maps, markers, trails  
- **Socket.IO Client** → real-time communication  
- **LocalStorage / JWT** → lightweight user/session management  

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express.js** → REST API & server logic  
- **Socket.IO** → real-time event-driven communication  
- **MongoDB** → persistent storage for rooms, users, and logs  
- **JWT Authentication** → secure route & room access  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. 🔐 **User Authentication** → Login/signup with email & password  
2. 🏠 **Room Creation / Join** → Users create or join existing rooms  
3. 📍 **Location Sharing** → Devices send live GPS updates to the server  
4. ⚡ **Real-Time Updates** → Socket.IO broadcasts positions to all members  
5. 🚨 **Anomaly Detection** → Detects stationary users or deviations  
6. 💬 **Communication** → Room chat with alerts & SOS integration  

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
- 📱 Mobile app (React Native) with background location tracking  
- 🧭 Smarter anomaly detection using ML (predict group paths)  
- 🛡️ End-to-end encryption for chat & location  
- 📊 Analytics dashboard for fleet admins
